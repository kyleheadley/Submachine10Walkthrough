Walkthrough for Submachine 10: The Exit
=======================================
<details><summary>Intro</summary>
Welcome to the final "Submachine" game! The series has spanned 10 episodes in as many years. The creator, Mateusz Skutnik, has finished up with the best art and longest trek so far. I've enjoyed the series greatly, so I wanted to put some work into a good walkthrough for others. Prior experience with Submachine in not necessary, but there are many references to previous games for those who want to look back.

The game world consists of 8 major areas, each of which has a portal back to a section of a previous Submachine game. The graphic style is that of the original, but updates were made so that they'd be appropriate to the new game. Most of the game play involves clicking switches, collecting items, and finding out where to put them.

There are a few parts to this walkthrough. I try to have progressive hints throughout, so that you can figure out as much as possible on your own. Also, each successive part is more detail oriented, so you can look for high level hints in the "Hints" section, detailed directions, you'll need to check out the "Efficiency" section.

"Explanations Walkthrough" leads you to clues to what you need before finding those items. It's a lot of back and forth, but hopefully you will understand what's going on. "Efficiency Walkthrough" is designed around subgoals for accessing the ending. Items are collected and used at convenient times with no explanation about what they are.

"Secrets" contains info for getting the ten small red balls that are used to access extra text just before finishing the game. Items used solely to acquire secrets are mostly ignored by the main walkthroughs, except under special spoiler tags.

I label areas mainly by their teleporter coordinates. So, '101' means first and third buttons depressed before activating teleporter. I also use a 'P' to mean through the powered portal. So '110P' means the area from the beginning of Sub 6: The Edge.

Remember that the game is designed so that you can't get stuck. No matter what you've done, what you have, or where you are, you can still reach the ending! (And you can still get all the secrets!)

Enjoy!
</details>
<details><summary>General Hints</summary>
- You're not stuck.
- Really, you're not stuck. The ending is reachable from any situation.
- The secrets are also reachable from any situation.
- If an item came from a device, it probably goes into a similar device.
- Mechanisms with little red and green lights need to be activated elsewhere.
- Pick up everything. There are no useless items.
- There are a few useless mechanisms.
- Most mechanisms have visual clues for how to activate them. Like missing pieces.
- If a mechanism stops working, you don't need it any more.
- Some obvious items are for non-obvious secrets. Progress is better than completion.
- There are some things you'll understand early, but can't be solved until much later.
- All ten secrets are small red balls. Some are hidden in "plain sight".
</details>
<details><summary>Descriptions Walkthrough</summary>
This takes you through the game, pointing out clues. It's more commentary than directions, so it's good if you want vague hints, or want to read about a previous section to see if you missed an obscured clue. The back story is left out, but you're led to in-game papers that describe it. Secrets are dealt with as if they were normal game items, but more vague and left out of the spoiler hints. This walkthrough is set up as if it's telling the protagonist's story. Read the Efficiency Walkthrough section if you need clearer guidance.

This is written as if we have everything we need to pass each obstacle. The player will have to jump back and forth between areas to actually reach the area in the next paragraph. Read about what you see, for subtle hints about what to do next. Spoiler hints will say where to go, but not what to do there or the best order to do anything.

Progressive spoilers: character of the game, descriptions and clues, search locations

1. <details><summary>Chapter 1: Where Am I?</summary>
  The first part of the game is simple and linear. Explore a bit, click to collect items, and use them where you can. Don't miss the 'Backpack' early on, you have limited inventory space! Figure out how the game works. Pass though rooms and portals. Find the teleporter to finish this part.

  1. <details><summary>Docks</summary>
    - We start off on an unstable platform with stone floating around. This seems to be a technologically mixed area that plaques call the Northern Garden docks. There are four labeled 'docks'. There's a ship anchored (literally) to one of the docks, but we can't see it. There's a ladder, but all it has is a glowing orb at the top. It seems small enough to grab. A hole in the ground leads to a machine that doesn't do anything, but does have a hole for something. Pieces of the wall are floating around. They seem to be centered on something. There's a building blocking our path. The circular device nearby looks like it might be useful.
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - Put the Light Sphere in the circular device to gain access to the building.
      </details>
    </details>
  2. <details><summary>Control Room</summary>
    - This is a modest building that seems in disrepair. There are some levers upstairs labeled like the docks. What dock was the ship at? There's a backpack by a chair that looks useful. The stairway doesn't go anywhere. What breaks up support beams but leaves them floating? There's a vending machine in the corner. It seems to require an id card. Maybe there's one on the ship?
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - Click the lever marked '3' to move the ladder to the ship.
      </details>
    </details>
  3. <details><summary>Ship</summary>
    - We can reach what seems to be a space ship, but it still needs power. Luckily, there's ship number card by the entrance, and those cables go right into the machine we saw.
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - Take the Id to the vending machine, insert it to get a Bottle Fuse, take it outside to the machine in the hole. Insert it and press the button.
      </details>
    - The ship is so old that there's mold everywhere! It's interesting to look at, but probably doesn't do anything anymore. Maybe there's some scrap to collect on board. We found the bridge, but the security is still in place, and we don't have a captain's ID badge, or whatever goes in the other slot. There's a hatch missing a handle, maybe that's still around somewhere.
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - The Door Valve is on the other side of the ship. Insert it into the hatch and click to open it.
      </details>
    </details>
  4. <details><summary>Old House</summary>
    - We found a karma portal like the ones in previous Submachine games. They'll probably take us to many unusual places. This place seems like an old house. The way is blocked a bit, but nothing too difficult to handle. There's a hole in the floor with a little red ball at the bottom. Looks like something valuable, but we can't reach it. Even if we found a long stick to reach, it's so far down that grabbing it would be a problem. There's some strange equipment around. One large capsule has lights on it and a panel that might open, but it won't and the device seems inactive. The nearby door is shut and not opening. There's another unusual device on a lower level, but it seems to be missing some parts. All the statues are facing some brick structure that seems subtly out of place with the house. It must be important.
    </details>
  </details>
2. <details><summary>Chapter 2: Grand Tour</summary>
  Now that you have access to a teleporter, there are many worlds to explore. Go from place to place collecting and using items. About half of them are used in the area you found them in, the rest go through the teleporter. Use the teleporter to get to areas new to this game. Use the powered portals to get to areas from previous Submachine games. You'll finish this part of the game when you gather all the pieces to activate the powered portal in the first area.

  1. <details><summary>001 The Pyramid</summary>
    - There's a bunch of ancient Egyptian stuff around, but the pyramid walls look like copper. There's a couple of geared devises on walls, but neither is complete. There's a totem with Hieroglyphics on it, and there are some papers around with the same symbols. A box on an upper level has the same symbol as the totem, but it doesn't seem to do anything. There are a couple of jackal heads that teleport us between them, which is odd because there are ladders that reach them both. There's also an odd gray stone device with buttons, attached to a socket. There's nothing around that fits in, though.
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - The last hieroglyph page is in 111. The Karma Vile for the stone device is in 110P. You get the first Cog Wheel from the box when the totem is set up properly. The other 3 are in 001P, 101P, and 011.
      </details>
    - The ladders both drop down into compartments below. There's a glowing portal down one, and a glowing device down the other. They look useful. 
    </details>
  2. <details><summary>010 The Excavation</summary>
    - Looks like a work site, but the drill is busted. It's turned off and there's a handle in what looks like red sand. It appears to be solid. There's sand on the other side too, but it doesn't fill the hole. There's a machine that seems to open a hatch somewhere. There's a glowing Range Confirmator that may need power.
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - Get the handle and put it on the drill. Open the handles and pull both levers to activate it.
      </details>
    The drill must have already done its work, because there is equipment down its hole. One of the Range Confirmators is in a socket with a green light. There are two other sockets with red lights. There are two airlocks, but one is missing a handle. We can get past the other one. There's a closed hatch and a bar that looks like a handle.
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - Open the other airlock with the handle, place both Confirmators in the sockets and activate the machine to open the hatch.
      </details>
    - There's a piece of paper with a some kind of rune on it here, and a large portal beyond the hatch.
    </details>
  3. <details><summary>011 Shiva</summary>
    - This place consists of three large metal spheres, connected by a large pipe. The pipe is busted open and we can climb inside. Unfortunately, there are security fields blocking access to two of the spheres. We can enter the third, which has some kind of rotating device. Activating it changes some of its lights from red to green and vise versa, but anything but the original position puts up a security gate to that we can't leave. We can go all the way around the largest sphere and enter through a hatch. It seems to be a computer interface. There are a lot of green lights around. What could those be?
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - Use a Insulator Cap found in 101P to block the exit security gate. We'll assume the that emergency protocol has also been activated. It's in 110P
      </details>
    - With the security gates partially deactivated we can enter all the spheres through the busted tube. The left sphere has a large portal in it. The right sphere now has a ladder visible that exits below. There's a copper Cog gear here.
    </details>
  4. <details><summary>100 Royal Storage</summary>
    This place is full of old structures that seem to be held together by advanced technology. There are time and space anomalies all around, so movement doesn't always end up where we expect. There are signs naming five separate storage facilities. There's nothing else of interest here.
    - 32/1 is all red brick inside. There doesn't seem to be any order to the rooms, and backtracking leads to new places rather than old ones. It would be easy to hide somthing in here. Luckily, the total number of rooms seems low. There are items scattered about, and two metal devices in walls. One seems to need completion, with oblong recesses in it. Another looks like a secure box we don't have access to.
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - Fill the first device with Karma Fuses to access the second.
      </details>
    - 33/1 is very small. There are some items on the floor, and you see all of it before returning to the entrance.
    - 33/2 is also very small. Every exit leads back to the entrance, except the ones at the entrance. There are some things on the floor, but the large portal seems to be the reason this vault exists. Unfortunately, it's not active. There are round sockets in the wall nearby. Maybe it construction wasn't completed.
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - Fill the corners with Loop Stabilizers to active the portal.
      </details>
    - 33/3 has much more space inside, and has some kind of order to it. The left doors all lead to the same places, and the same is true for the other doors and ladders. Backtracking to previous rooms is somewhat possible. There are a lot of devises on the walls! Most of them have red and green indicators and labels, though there is one dial with labels from all the other devices, and one with multiple red lights with a panel that might open. There's also a large capsule here that looks similar to the one near the first teleporter. Far from the entrance, there's a paper with some history about an escapee. Maybe there's hope of escaping?
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - Activate each device after setting the dial to its label. 
      </details>
    - 33/4 is also large, but as long as we don't go too far and end up at the entrance, we can backtrack through any rooms we visit. There are items lying around and a paper on the wall with a strange symbol on it. There are three devices on walls. One of them has two indicator lights on it.
    - <details>
      - Activate the two devices and then collect an item from the one with lights.
      </details>
    </details>
  5. <details><summary>101 Cliff Side</summary>
    - There's not much here. There's an older stone statue of an ox that's missing some pieces, a paper with some strange message about multiple dimensions, and a piston. The piston activates a ladder that leads to an upper ledge. The piston there is missing, though, so we can't reach higher. There's a big spherical machine that is missing something according to the pedestal nearby. There's a metal piece that's almost fallen off the ledge, but it doesn't fit in the machine.
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - The Stone Grapes are in 011P and 001. The other ox statue is in 110. The Ladder Piston is in the ship near the start of the game. The Data Tape is in 001P.
      </details>
    - Even with the machine satisfied, it doesn't seem to do anything useful. It only says that it's finished was it was doing. Maybe those cables are communicating with some other machine? The upper ledge has paper with a strange symbol on it. And a large portal.
    </details>
  6. <details><summary>110 Murtaugh's Lab</summary>
    This place is huge! It also seems to be falling apart, like the docks, there are paths that lead to empty space and broken walls floating about. There's a machine on the far wall with a socked for some large device. There are three doors around the teleporter.
    - The left room is the most broken up, and things are scattered around the floor. There's a paper on the wall. Someone may have been studying the strange behavior.
    - The center room was poorly barricaded, probably because of some fancy equipment in it and its back room. There's a large capsule here like the one near the first teleporter. There's also a magnifying glass that doesn't have an experiment running. We could use it if needed without disturbing anything. There are skulls on tables and in drawers. Why would anyone want to look at skulls?
    - The third door just leads to three more! The left one has an out-of-place old stone statue of an ox, and a box with mostly small things around it. The center door leads to a large portal. It's got a number of smaller devices connected to it with wires. Half of them have green lights and hold a metal thing like the ones lying around the floors here. The other half are empty with red lights. The right door contains a large version on an experiment. The experimenter seems to have found a way to repair broken walls!
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - Fill the portal devices with Vector Finders. 3 are here, the others are in 101 and 100.
      </details>
    </details>
  7. <details><summary>111 The Monastery</summary>
    - If there were monks here once, they lived a spartan life. Most interesting things look like they came from elsewhere. There's a paper with what looks like hieroglyphics on it. There's a metal bar near a statue. There's a large capsule like the one near the first teleporter. There's some electric device, that could be a sender or receiver. There's a large portal that looks like it belongs here, strangely enough, but it's not active. There's also a circular stand like the one used to gain access to the control room to power the ship. Too bad we can't remove the Light Sphere from there.
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - Use a Light Sphere from 101P or 100P to get an item that powers the portal. 
      </details>
    </details>
  8. <details><summary>001P Submachine 5: The Root</summary>
    - We no longer have the metal keys to use the local teleporter, and it looks damaged by the karma portal anyway, so we're stuck in this area. The Coil we placed back then seems to have exploded, leaving a Light Sphere. There's a gear in the tub that looks out of place. We can move some panels from the wall to reveal a handle we didn't notice before. There's a ladder that leads to a socket in the wall. Opening the panel reveals that it's empty. Perhaps there's another one somewhere so we know what kind of thing plugs in.
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - Get a Root Finder from 101P to collect an item from below.
      </details>
    </details>
  9. <details><summary>010P Submachine 4: The Lab</summary>
    - We've been on this roof before, but the ladder is broken, so we can't get to the familiar areas. There's a force field blocking the path, but it's controlled from our side. That's pretty sloppy security, or there's something inside that's important enough to stay there. There's a Light Sphere set up to get us into a new section of the lab. There's a page on the wall, something about time travel. There's a metal Ladder Step nearby, but there's no way it would fit the wooden ladder outside. There's another security device set up, this one is actually keeping us out. Maybe it's as sloppy as the one outside and we can trick it somehow.
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - There's a Chip with security codes hidden in 011P, but you'll need to head to 110 to actually get at it.
      </details>
    - Past the security is a workbench with a tank of karma like the one from the other lab. This one is set up to dispense it. Maybe if we had an appropriate container we could use it to do the miracles we saw in the other lab?
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - The container is in 000, and the miracle works, so it's a late-game item.
      </details>
    </details>
  10. <details><summary>011P Submachine 7: The Core</summary>
    - This is the large shrine we visited before, but it seems to have aged quite a bit. The telescopes that haven't fallen apart still point to the same locations, but the electrical equipment is broken down an full of stones. There are floating blocks outside; this place may be damaged by the same thing that damaged others. The entrance we used last time is completely gone. Looks like someone visited at one point, but there's nothing left of them now but a suit and a skull. There's a large machine in one room that looks like the one on the cliff. The pedestal has the same message on it as well. There's a note left behind saying someone will be back here eventually. Hope that wasn't them in the suit.
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - Satisfying the machine at 101 will provide an item here.
        </details>
      </details>
  11. <details><summary>100P Submachine 3: The Loop</summary>
    - This was the place we were stuck doing puzzles for what seemed like forever. The rooms aren't stable like before, though. They're randomized like in another vault. There are so many rooms, it's hard to reach a location. There are two valve enclosures with four positions each, but one valve is missing. There are two receiver bells with dials that need activation before they'll turn. All four of these items are labeled. There's a devise with all those labels on it, with similar bells, and columns with lights that might move. There's a grid of some kind of material, with the corners of the grid missing. There's a device that seems to be ripped out and has wires dangling. Finally, there's a mount with two lights, presumably where the reward for this puzzle is kept.
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - The missing valve is in the basement past the back door of 000. It might still be locked at this point. Use the valves to line up the lights with a bell, then turn the dial of the corresponding bell. Repeat. Grab the reward. More hints are in the Efficiency Walkthrough, but this is a long difficult puzzle, so don't get discouraged.
      </details>
    </details>
  12. <details><summary>101P Submachine 8: The Plan</summary>
    - This is a small section of a world visited not long before. The Coil is still there powering the dimensional locater, but the ladder is missing. We no longer have the controller that let us jump between worlds. Luckily, someone has set up a light sphere crown to get us into the pod without it.
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - There's a Light Sphere below and the other is in 001P.
      </details>
    - Some of the equipment has been removed from the pod, but they left a Cog above and didn't open the hatch after unlocking it. We've seen some Ladder Steps around, maybe if we get enough we can reach the area below us for the first time.
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - The 3 Steps are in 111, 010P, and 110P.
      </details>
    - We made it down the ladder! There is a Light Sphere here, along with instructions for setting up the crown above. There is a little round device in a computer socket that isn't doing anything but make blue light. Maybe it will be of more use elsewhere. 
    </details>
  13. <details><summary>110P Submachine 6: The Edge</summary>
    - This the the place we were dropped off to die when we couldn't pass a security check. The teleporter looks worse than before, and pieces of wall have fallen down, revealing an entrance we never say before. Too bad there's no valve on that hatch. There's some new equipment set up, some sockets, what could those have been for? Around the corner, there's a paper with a strange symbol on the wall. The path beyond seems to have broken off. The vents are rusted enough to remove the covers and enter.
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - There's a fuse for the socket in the lighthouse. The valve is in one of the vents.
      </details>
    - There's a security system on through the left vent, but all the green balls needed to disable it are there. There are some items on pedestals (or fallen off), those must be important. There's also a large capsule like the one near the first teleporter.
    - The right vent has a four-way split with a machine controlling where to go, but it's blocked, so we can only go up. There's another one of those robot storage devices that seem to be everywhere. This one has something glowing in it. The valve nearby is locked just like the entry machine is.
    - <details>
      - The Block Remover Tool is in the other vent. Use it on the center of the machine, unlocking it and the valves.
      </details>
    - The valves control which two exits are open at any time. There are a few items around that could be useful, including the Hatch Valve for the hatch outside. Beyond the hatch is another security point like the one in the vent, but this one is missing the Plasma Charges that unlock it. We'll have to find those.
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - There's a Charge in each vent, and the other in in 011.
      </details>
    - Beyond the security point is a monitor and a door labeled S3C. The monitor is for activating an evacuation protocol, but it doesn't open the door. It's a computer, so it's probably connected to somewhere else. Perhaps there's a way out available now.
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - The protocol is for 011. The door is opened in the ship at the beginning of the game.
        </details>
      - It's like a treasure vault in here! There are nearly a dozen security stops, which lead to info about this place. We had a few of the little red balls that access it all. We should look for others.
    </details>
  14. <details><summary>111P Submachine 9: The Temple</summary>
    - We just came from here but it looks like a lot of time has past. There's a lot more red 'sand' everywhere, and the only accessible plaque is broken. It covers up most of the places we knew about. Finding an item in this would be like finding an needle in a haystack. There is one place to go, past a hole in the stairway where it looks like someone set up a dimensional locater. Too bad we don't have the control device, but it's broken anyway. There's a wire to some holding cylinder. If we can power it we might salvage something from this trip.
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - The Coil is in 101P
      </details>
    </details>
  </details>
3. <details><summary>Chapter 3: Down the Rabbit Hole and Back</summary>
  This part of the game is again more linear, with a little backtracking. Explore the oldest sections of Submachine games in order to open up the rest of the options. Don't be afraid when the exit disappears on you. You'll find another way out to end this part of the game.

  1. <details><summary>000P Submachine 2: The Lighthouse</summary>
    - This place was the real beginning of journey through the Submachine. Now it's so full of this red stuff that we can't go very far. There's a Light Sphere where the wisdom crystal was once. But it was taken, so the light is a mystery. The box with all the wires seems to have blown a fuse or something, since one of the levers is inactive. The path up is blocked, but there's a light crown around to get us to the other side of the room. The ladder won't extend, one of the wires is broken. There's a little box like the one in the lab nearby. There's also a transmitter hooked up to a grid of strange symbols, like the ones we've found on paper.
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - Enter the 4 runes into the transmitter. The papers are at 010, 100, 101P, and 110P. The receiver is at 111. Use the item to fix the wire, and pull the lever on the box to extend the ladder
      </details>
    </details>
  2. <details><summary>Submachine 1: The Basement</summary>
    - Ah, the original Submachine game console. There's a note about the lab stuff nearby, but the game is where we first noticed something was different. And there's a karma portal here. Maybe we can here from somewhere else originally? Through the portal is a setup like at the end of the game, but it's all real... and fake! It's a bunch of paintings that make it look like we've reached the outside. The path circles a tower, but part of it is broken up with more floating walls. There's an elevator here. Looking out from it the paintings seem real. Well, real enough for a game. This is the ending of Submachine, and we're retracing our steps back through it. Maybe it was all real after all?
    - Well, these red rooms are new, but the elevator disappeared from under the same symbol it appeared under back then. There seem to be unsolved problems here. Levers and stones and switches. It's still like a game setup, everything nearby just needs to be rearranged properly, and maybe we'll get to the portal behind the glass. The raised bed doesn't seem all that necessary, though.
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - The stone goes on the scale, the stone gets turned to match the mark on the other one, the switches need to be flipped, and all 4 levers can be collected and inserted into their spots around the glass.
      </details>
    - Now this is familiar! All the puzzles here are just as we left them, but more broken apart and moldy. It must have been real after all! Well, lets collect all the items from before, maybe they'll be useful outside. There's a portal where the original exit was. The wisdom crystal is missing of course, but there's another Light Sphere in its place. Maybe they 'grow back' after a long enough time? Continuing to retrace our steps leads us back to the old house. Did we come from here originally?
    </details>
  </details>
4. <details><summary>Chapter 4: Cleaning Up the Mess</summary>
  This part of the game is about traveling around, dealing with all the unfinished business you've noticed along the way. Find a way to reconstruct damaged sections of the world. Collect and use all the secrets now. Reach the giant bulb at the top of the lighthouse to move on to the last part.

  1. <details><summary>Find a tool</summary>
    - We're back at the house, and have access to every location and portal. Are there any mysteries we couldn't deal with before that we can now? How about the large capsule right here by the door?
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - Use the 4 Fuses from the basement to activate the 4 capsules. They're in 100, 110, 110P and 111.
      </details>
    - There's an Empty Karma Stabilizer inside. Perhaps we should fill it with karma?
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - The karma tank is in 010P.
      </details> 
    </details>
  2. <details><summary>Perform the miracles</summary>
    - Leaving the lab, we see that the roof tiles dislodged by proximity to the karma portal are reacting to the Stabiliser. Using the Stabiliser on them actually fixes the broken roof! How many other places did we come across that had broken, floating pieces?
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - at least 11 ;-) (but one was the roof you just fixed, and two can't be fixed)
      </details>
    - There were so many places to go! Mostly there were Tiles to collect. There was a pathway with a message about a sentient machine, a box of junk that looked interesting, and more! The one in the basement was really confusing, The submachine game seems like a real place, but the portal took us to some electronic world. Were we really in the game? This last place has a door that seems to be unlocked by placing Tiles above it. Let's see if we have all 4.
    - <details>
      - The tiles are in repaired karma portals in 000, 000P, 110, docks.
      </details>
    </details>
  </details>
5. <details><summary>Chapter 5: Leaving the Submachine</summary>
  Almost done! The karma doorway leads to the top of the lighthouse. The items in the there are used to acquire the pieces of the final mechanism. It's not very hard either. Just don't activate it if you want to try to get all the secrets. You have to start over from the beginning once you see the ending.
  
  1. <details><summary>Enter the Lighthouse (Submachine 2)</summary>
    - Past the doorway is a steel room with a note about entering the Submachine, and what looks like a security system. There are two fuse sockets that may need to be filled.
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - The Fuses are in 011P and 100P
      </details>
    - The ladder leads to the lighthouse. There's another note about a sentient machine. The large lamp we powered back then is still active! Too bad it didn't take us out of the submachine then. Better not try again that way. Since it didn't work, we might as well take these items nearby.
    <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - The large lamp still leads back into the loop like it did before!
      </details>
    </details>
  2. <details><summary>Leave the Submachine for good</summary>
    - With the ID we can get further into the ship. It turns out it was just an observation deck, but there's some equipment up here. There's also a note about the lamp turning off. Will someone be expecting us? 
    - We have a Portable Light Crown and the Light Sphere that activates it. Now all we need is a place to set it up. There was a note about needing something else as well. Maybe whatever that is will be the last clue to making this work.
    - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
      - The note was in 101P, get the Converter in 110P. Set it all up in the lighthouse.
      </details>
    </details>
  3. <details><summary>Enjoy the Ending!</summary>
    They are Murtaugh and Elizabeth. They are the people the notes have been written by or about for the entire Submachine series. See the karma arm? This game would have been much easier with one of those!

<details><summary>Efficiency Walkthrough</summary>
Here you'll find what I think is a really efficient path through the game. It's not the common path, but I've left directions in each goal for getting the stuff you've missed if you're not following along. It's divided into milestones and steps. If you don't know what to do, check which milestones you've completed and take a look under the next one you haven't.

Progressive spoilers: strategy, steps broken down, solutions and pointers

1. <details><summary>Reach the Teleporter</summary>
  Look around and do a bunch of obvious stuff. You can ignore the Backpack if you're following this walkthrough, but you may want it just in case. You'll eventually find a red and white mechanism with three buttons in a row and one underneath. That's the teleporter. The top three set the location and the bottom one activates it, sending you to another, different-looking teleporter. You're at 000 currently.

  - <details><summary>Step-by-step</summary>
    1. There's a Light Sphere at the top of the ladder
    2. Use it to access the building. 
    3. Use the levers to move the ladder to the ship.

    </details>
  - <details><summary>Secrets</summary>
    None accessible now
    </details> 
  </details>
2. <details><summary>Activate the '110' Powered Portal</summary>
  For this we need 5 Vector Finders, but 3 are in 110 in rooms near the portal. We need to teleport to two places to get them before heading to the portal. For efficiency, we should take a Plasma Charge with us, found in a fourth teleport location, and well hidden. You can get all of these items without needing any others.

  - <details><summary>Step-by-step</summary>
    1. Visit 100, get the Vector Finder, it's somewhere left of the teleporter
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        Enter the storage vault, there's only one left of the teleporter. The doors lead to 5 random rooms, so keep clicking until you see a metal object in front. Get it and click doors until you see the vault arms, signifying the exit.
        </details>
    2. Visit 101, get the Vector Finder, it's nearby
      - <details>
        Use the Piston to call the ladder. Take it up one screen, the Vector Finder is a metal object on the edge of that ledge.
        </details>
    3. Visit 011, get the Plasma Charge, it's a small green sphere
      - <details>
        Follow the ladders all the way around the spheres. Enter the large one at the hatch and go to the left of the massive computer. One of the glowing green things is the Plasma Charge.
        </details>
    4. Visit 110, three rooms have Vector Finders, one has the portal
      - <details>
        Enter the door left of the teleporter, the Vector Finder is down the stairs. Enter the door right of the teleporter, the Vector finder is past obstacles, down a hallway, and inside a desk. Enter the door further right of the teleporter, to see three more doors. The Vector Finder is in the right room and the portal is in the center room.
        </details>
    5. Activate the Portal
      - <details>
        With the Vector Finders selected, click each socket with a red light to insert the Vector Finder. The portal will glow blue.
        </details>
    </details>
  - <details><summary>Secrets</summary>
    Secret 1 is in the vault, you'll be back later, so no pressure. An item for accessing the secret room is here.
    </details>
  </details>
3. <details><summary>Complete the Ladder</summary>
  For this we need 3 Ladder Steps, each in a different teleport location. One is, as you've guessed, behind the portal we just activated. While we're there, we'll save ourselves a trip by getting a rune and activating Shiva's emergency exit protocol. The second Step is a quick grab like the Vector Finders, but we'll collect a paper with a hint while we're there. The third Step will take some work, since we need to gain access to the powered portal to reach it. 

  - <details><summary>Step-by-step</summary>
    1. Enter the portal at 110, find the crawl vents and rune paper.
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        Go left, click to open, left again for rune
        </details>
    2. Enter the left vent, then the right, collecting everything
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        Both vents only have a few rooms. The left one is easy, collect the Plasma Charge, click to deactivate the security grid, and collect the Block Removal Tool. The right one needs the Removal Tool to get the center mechanism working, then there's a wheel in rooms to rotate it. Click once when going through, 3 times when going back. Collect the Plasma Charge in the first room, Ladder Step in the second, and Hatch Valve and Karma Vial in the third.
        </details>
    3. Enter the Hatch right of the portal, activate Shiva's emergency protocol
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        It's high up on the wall. Connect the Hatch Valve and open it. Inside, place the three Plasma Charges in the box and click the screen to deactivate the barrier. If you're missing a Charge, get it from 011. Click the large screen and click the protocol toggle to change it.
        </details>
    4. Visit 111, collect the Ladder Step and paper with Hieroglyphics
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        </details>
        Step is far right of teleporter, paper is far left.
    5. Visit 010, activate the drill
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        At the far left of the teleporter is a handle, connect it to the drill and open both handles. Pull the lever you just passed, then come back and pull the handled cord to activate the drill
        </details>
    6. Grab items underground and use them there to find the portal
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        Enter the hole right of the teleporter, collect the Range Confirmator. Enter the drill hole, place the Confirmator in one of the sockets. Get the Air Lock Handle in the bottom right and use it to open the Lock at the bottom left. Get the other Confirmator and the rune paper behind it. Place the Confirmator in the other socket. Activate the hatch in the other hole, then return to the hatch to find the portal beneath.
        </details>
    7. Enter the portal, collect the Ladder Step
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        Grab the Canister powering the portal blocking your path and proceed inside the building. The Ladder Step is down the stairs and to the left.
        </details>
    8. Visit 101 again, grab the rune paper, enter the portal, finish the Ladder
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        Go up to the second ledge this time. If you don't have the Ladder Piston set up, get it from the Ship and set it up. There's a rune paper at the top, then the portal. The ladder is just left of the portal, use the Steps to complete it.
        </details>
    </details>
  - <details><summary>Secrets</summary>
    The Secret Vault is the door labeled S3C, but you can't get in yet
    </details>
  </details>
4. <details><summary>Acquire the Second Light Sphere</summary>
  The first sphere is just beyond the ladder in 101P, but this is the 'harder' one to get. If you found the 'easy' one first, see 'Complete the Ladder' above to access this one. Use the Light Sphere to access the pod, and collect the other 4 items in this area. There are no more puzzles here. Avoid the paper. It has a hint for the end of the game, but it will fill an extra inventory slot so it's not worth it unless you're collecting them. After this area we'll grab the other Cog Wheel, and go collect the 'easy' Sphere. We waited so that we can complete that entire area, including past the portal, in one trip!

  - <details><summary>Step-by-step</summary>
    1. Collect 4 items in 101P
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        There's a Root Finder left of the ladder. Use the Light Sphere to access the pod. There's a Cap in the hatch and a Cog up above. The Coil is next to the portal out.
        </details>
    2. Visit 011, the route has changed, and there's a Cog Wheel nearby
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        Enter the busted tube and head into the lower sphere. Use the Insulator Cap on the mechanism to avoid getting locked in. Head into the large sphere and take the ladder down to get the Cog Wheel. If there's no ladder, activate it in 110P. If you don't have the Plasma Charge you need, it's at the left of this large sphere. The instructions are in 'Complete the Ladder' above.
        </details>
    3. Visit 001, reach the portal
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        You should already have the Cog you need, but you'll need the other one in a minute so lets get it. There's a totem right of the teleporter. Go up twice to find the hint papers for it. They are Hieroglyphics and repeated symbols show you how to line up the papers. If you don't have the third one already, you can get it from 111, but it would be easier now to just try all the options for the last symbol. The box up and to the left will be open if all the symbols are correct. Collect the large Cog Wheel and use it in the nearby mechanism to lower the ladder. There are two, but the Cog only fits in the correct one. Follow the ladder down to reach the portal.
        </details>
    4. Collect 3 items past the portal, including the Light Sphere
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        The Light Sphere is visible, and the small Cog Wheel is in the tub. 
        Clear the metal plates on the far right to access another portal. Use the Root Path Finder (described above) to reach the Data Tape.
        </details>
    5. Finish up the area by collecting the last 2 items
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        Exit the portal and use the Cogs (described above) in the other mechanism. Head down to the jackal head and click until it brings you to the other one. There's a ladder down to a Portal Charge, and a device that takes the Karma Vial and gives a Stone Grape when the third button from the top is clicked. If you don't have the Karma Vial, get it from the tunnels left of 110P. Use the Jackal to get back to the teleporter.
        </details>
    </details>
  - <details><summary>Secrets</summary>
    Nothing here
    </details>
  </details>
5. <details><summary>Activate the '000' Powered Portal</summary>
  By now you've seen most of the areas, and we'll see most of the rest for this objective. The goal is to make use of your items to get 3 Portal Stabilisers and a Portal Charge. We have to visit one of two locations twice to finish up, so we'll pick the one that's quicker. Depending on how you used the first Light Sphere, you may have different items, so the first step is to use the second Sphere to get caught up.

  - <details><summary>Step-by-step</summary>
    1. If you haven't yet, use the Light Sphere at 101P, then finish 001
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        This is described above in 'Acquire the Second Light Sphere'. The end result should be: Insulator Cap, Coil, Portal Charge, Stone Grape, Data Tape
        </details>
    2. Use the other Sphere in 111, get the Portal Stabiliser in 111P
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        You can use the Sphere down the right ladder. You get a Glyph that powers the portal. There's only one thing to do in 111P, go left and up the stairs to plug in the Coil and find the Stabiliser at the end of the wire.
        </details>
    3. Quick stop at 101 to drop off the Data Tape
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        That big computer on the ledge needs it
        </details>
    4. Visit 011P, get Stabiliser, Grape, and Skull
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        If you can't get there, use the Insulator Cap in the lower sphere to enter the left sphere. There's a Grape Stone in the box on the floor, a Skull in one of the rooms, and a Stabiliser in another.
        </details>
    5. Quick stop at 101 to drop off 2 Grape Stones
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        The ox statue to the left needs completion
        </details>
    6. Visit 110 to get the Stabiliser, drop off Canister
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        Go right from the teleporter. The door left of the portal door has the Stabiliser. Left from the teleporter is a socket for the Plasma Canister. Take the short detour if you're collecting secrets, it will save an inventory space.
        </details>
    7. Activate the 000 Portal
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        Actually, don't do it yet. Save the trip and start the next walkthrough section to get the clue first. It's a big milestone so it deserved to be written here... You have all the items, so head right and down from the teleporter to reach the portal. Plug in the 3 Stabilizers and Portal Charge, then press the lever to activate the portal.
        </details>
    </details>
  - <details><summary>Secrets</summary>
    Secret 2 is in the tomb. Secret 3 is in the shrine, you'll be back there later.
    </details>
  </details>
6. <details><summary>Open the Back Door to '000'</summary>
  The puzzles here are mostly local, so enter the portal and keep pressing forward. There's a place to backtrack at the beginning, so we'll get the last rune paper first to minimize that. There are a bunch of items to get just before reaching the door, so it's best to get them now.

  - <details><summary>Step-by-step</summary>
    1. Visit 100 to get the last rune paper
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        Far right of the teleporter there's a ladder up to 33/4. Enter and go right until you see the rune paper on the wall. Go right again to return to the entrance so you can leave. There are puzzles here, but now is not the time to do them. You should have 4 rune papers now. The others are in 101, 110P, and 010.
        </details>
    2. Activate the transmitter in the basement
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        The portal from 000 is right and down from the teleporter. Head down to get a Light Sphere, then up to use it. Left of the path past that is where you enter the runes. Each input has a different set of runes, so click until you see one that's on your papers. Like the temple totem, nothing will happen here when you set all the runes. Now we backtrack and find the receiver.
        </details>
    3. Reach the elevator
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        The rune receiver is in 111, down the ladder left of the teleporter. Take the fork and return to the blocked path. Use it to complete the wire, then head around to the box near the area entrance. Flip the switch to lower the ladder. Head back to the ladder. Use the portal below and head left to the elevator.
        </details>
    4. Solve the red room puzzles
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        Click elevator buttons to reach the red rooms. The puzzles here are all self-contained. Move back and forth between rooms, flipping switches, grabbing items and using them. You'll finish by releasing the glass covering a portal out.
        - <details><summary>More</summary>
          You need 4 Levers. One is on the ground. One is accessed by pressing both switches, then retrieving it from the upper right room. For the third, take the Stone Weight from the lower right and put it on the platform in the lower left. Finally, check the notch in the stone wheels. Move the one to line up with the other, and take the Lever from device just left of the exit. Put all the Levers around the exit to access the portal. An efficient path is: right, all down, all up, all left, exit.
          </details>
        </details>
    5. Grab some stuff on your way back
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        This is a reminiscing area, with no puzzles left to solve. Go down, left and grab the four white fuses. Then up, left, up to the portal. Before you go, you should get the Valve just left of the portal, and the Light Sphere right and all the way up from the portal.
        </details>
    6. Remove the beam from the door to reach 000
    </details>
  - <details><summary>Secrets</summary>
    An item for Secret 10 is near the rune paper, but we don't need it yet and will be back later. Secret 4 is here, you have to backtrack to the red rooms. Items needed for Secrets 4, 5, 6, and 7 are in the yellow rooms.
    </details>
  </details>
7. <details><summary>Fill the Stabiliser with Karma</summary>
  Now we can satisfy the large capsules that we've seen around the place. That will get us a Stabiliser, which we can then fill to make it useful. The idea is straight forward, but it's a major milestone that involves searching back through places we've been.

  - <details><summary>Step-by-step</summary>
    1. If you missed them, get the 4 Fuses and Skull
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        The fuses are in the yellow rooms through the back door in 000, the Skull is from 011P
        </details>
    2. Visit 111, place fuse
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        It's down the ladder left of the teleporter
        </details>
    3. Visit 100 33/3, place fuse
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        Second storage room right of the teleporter. Go right once from the entrance, place the fuse and return the way you came. Again, there are puzzles here, but we'll get to them later.
        </details>
    4. Visit 110, place fuse, get Chip
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        The large capsule is through the door right of the teleporter and down the hall. On the other side of that room is a magnifying glass you can use to examine the Skull.
        </details>
    5. Visit 110P, place fuse
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        Go through the left crawl vent and alternate right and up until you reach the large capsule.
        </details>
    6. Return to 000, collect Empty Karma Stabiliser
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        It's by the door left of the teleporter.
        </details>
    7. Visit 010P, fill Stabiliser 
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        There's a security point in the lower level. Move the pedestal with a click and place the Explorer's Chip on it. Click the scanner to proceed. Put the Stabiliser on the lab equipment and turn the dial on the tank to fill it.
        </details>
    </details>
  - <details><summary>Secrets</summary>
    Secret 6 is in the lab.
    </details>
  </details>
8. <details><summary>Enter the Lighthouse</summary>
  The Stabiliser allows us to enter many new (small) areas. We need to collect 4 Tiles from them, and 2 Plasma Coils. We finally solve the puzzles in the Royal Storage, unless they've been completed along the way.

  - <details><summary>Step-by-step</summary>
    1. Visit 100, activate portal
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        Explore the vaults looking for Loop Stabilisers and Karma Fuses. They're all 'loops', so doors may not lead where you expect. Start on the right of the teleporter. Down the ladder you can get one of each item pretty easily. The next vault has a Fuse at the right and the portal on the left of the entrance. The next vault has a puzzle to get an item. Set a switch, then activate the corresponding mechanism. Repeat until you get the Stabiliser. The upper vault is hardest to navigate. Solve the puzzle by clicking two different levers, and a panel with a Stabiliser will open. A Fuse is on the ground. Head left of the teleporter to the other vault. Find a Fuse on the ground and use all 4 in a mechanism. Click to activate. Find the Stabiliser in an opened panel. Head right of the teleporter to the first vault. Enter and place the Stabilisers around the portal.
        - <details><summary>If you're really stuck</summary>
          33/3:
              Enter, Left, Dial to '1', Up, Set Device,  Left, Dial to '2', Right, Right, Right, Set Device, Right, Left, Dial to '3', Down, Set Device, Left, Dial to glyph, Down, Down, Get item, Down, Exit.
          33/4:
              Enter, Left, Left, Get item, Up, Set Device, Right, Right, Right, Down, Set Device, Up, Left, Get Item, Left, Exit.
          </details>
        </details>
    2. Visit 100P, get Plasma Coil
      - <details><summary>Hint</summary>
        This is the most difficult and annoying puzzle in the game. There are 10 rooms that you reach randomly with each exit click. There are two dials to turn that need to be activated by certain configurations of two Valves, one of which needs to be placed from the inventory. It's all coordinated visually by a device with two small lights on two labeled columns and two labeled transmitter horns. Horns correspond with dials and columns correspond with valves. Set the valves so that the two lights are even with a horn, forming an electric arc. Turn the dial for that horn, which should be lit up. Repeat. Find the panel that should now have two green lights on it. Click to get the Plasma Coil. Find the entrance and get out.
